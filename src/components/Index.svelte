        <p>My first hypothesis was that it has something to do with what has been called the “TikTok accent” or the influencer accent.</p>
        <p>“The influencer accent everyone is talking about sounds like that because it’s designed to manipulate you,” said Adam Aleksic — a content creator that makes videos about linguistics — in an explainer of the accent. </p>

        <p>One of them is <span class="bold">vocal fry,</span> which is when the speech sounds more gravelly. </p>

        <p>The second is <span class="bold">upspeak,</span> which is when you end sentences the same way you end questions.</p>

        <p>According to Aleksic, who goes by Etymologynerd on TikTok, a key feature of the accent is the upspeak. </p>

        <p>“The staccato uptick in your voice when you’re talking keeps people watching for three main reasons,” said Aleksic. </p>

        <div class="blockquote">
            <p>“First, the rising tones makes it sound like the video is always unfinished, so people have to keep watching because they can tell that something is coming next. </p>
            <p>Second is they’re seeking validation from you all the time, so you as the viewer feel like you’re more actively participating in the video, which makes you more engaged with it, and also you just feel more comfortable with the informal vibe.</p>
            <p>Third, it’s metalinguistic signaling, communicating social information. It’s telling people I’m a certain kind of person. I’m an influencer. And then that frames your perception of how much you think you’re going to enjoy the video.“</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>I'm going to focus on the second prominent feature: <span class="bold">upspeak.</span></p>

        <p>If you listen to the clip again:</p>

        <div class="sound">
            <WaveFormPlayer

            />
        </div>

        <p>The uptalk stands out a lot.</p> 

        <p>It almost sounds like they’re overdoing the uptalk — much more so than any other genre on TikTok.</p>

        
    </div>

    <DensityChart />

    <div class="content">
        <p>For example, in this 15s clip,</p>

        <div class="sound-close-reading">

                <AudioPlayer src='/media/audio/7366018710248672517.mp3' />

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>we can see that words like Amazon, and Products are emphasised.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>In a 2018 paper by Burdin and Tyler, they found that this rise in intonation tends to be found when people list things off as well.</p>
        <p>In their study, they found that rises were associated with feelings of helpfulness, niceness, and friendliness towards the speaker. </p>
        <p>The speaker also comes across as more prepared about what they are saying, and the speaker that used “rises” was heard as “informing” and “instructive”.</p>
